\begin{enumerate}
    
    \item   Include all the data in the appendix
    \item   Reference data/materials not easily available (theses are used as a resource by the department and other students)
    \item   Tables (where more than 1-2 pages)
    \item   Calculations (where more than 1-2 pages)
    \item   Include a key article as appendix
    \item   If you consulted a large number of references but did not cite all of them, you might want to include a list of additional resource material, etc
    \item   List of equipment used for an experiment or details of complicated procedures
    \item   Figures and tables, including captions, should be embedded in the text and not in an appendix, unless they are more than 1-2 pages and are not critical to your argument
